# Tycoon
A simple tycoon module that creates and manages a "company"
# How to Use?
The user creates a tycoon class in which assets and money can be added to. These assets can be 
bought or sold. Each asset bought/sold can increase/decrease the amount of revanue per time interval
# Problems
While using the generate command an infinite loop is initiated. The system has problems exiting once this occurs.
I found that closing the terminal window is the only solution. Cntr-C doesn't work.
